Bellybutton Challenge ReadMe

# Summary:

This project involves building an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs microbial species found in human navels. To accomplish the task, I will be using the D3 library to create horizontal bar and bubble charts displaying top OTUs and sample data, respectively. Additionally, demographic information will be displayed for each sample. Finally, the dashboard will update dynamically based on user-selected samples, and the deployment will be done via GitHub Pages.
